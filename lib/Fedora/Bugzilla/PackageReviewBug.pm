=head1 NAME

Fedora::Bugzilla::PackageReviewBug - bug + some reviewing magic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # set as default bug class
    $bz->default_bug_class('Fedora::Bugzilla::PackageReviewBug');

    # get bugs as normal...
    my $bug = $bz->bug('perl-Moose');
    
    # profit!


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a small extension to Fedora::Bugzilla::Bug, providing a few
review-bug-specific methods / attributes.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

An object of this class represents a package review bug.

=over 4

=item B<ready_for_branching>

Returns true if the flags indicate we're ready to branch.  The logic is pretty
primitive right now; basically just check to see fedora-review == + and
fedora-cvs isn't set (to anything).

=item B<ready_for_closing>

True if both branched() and approved() are true.  We should probably put some
sort of "imported and built" check in here?  Maybe?

=item B<package_name>

Takes the summary and extracts the package name from it.  Note we expect this
to be filled out in the bug correctly, though we do try to be a little
flexible here.

e.g. from:

    Review Request: perl-WWW-Curl - Perl extension...

we return:

    perl-WWW-Curl

=item B<package_desc>

The package description, also from the summary.  From the above example, this
would be "Perl extension...", where hopefully the "..." makes sense :-)

=item B<approved>

Basically just a shortcut to check for the existance of the fedora-review
flag, and then to make sure it's set to '+'.  True if this is the case, false
otherwise.

If fedora-review is not set (+/-/?) on the bug, we check to see if we block
either of the old-school blocker bugs: FE-ACCEPT and FC-ACCEPT.  If we block
either of those, then we're in an approved state.

=item B<branched>

True if we have fedora-cvs and it's '+'; false otherwise.
